# Homework 5 Work Day Scheduler

## Description
The motivation of this project was to design a work scheduling
program that allows the user to enter tasks into time blocks
corresponding to the hour. The blocks will highlight grey
if the hour is in the past, red if its the current hour, and
green if the hour is in the future.

This project was built to gain experience using APIs such as
jQuery, Bootstrap, and moment.js.

This project implements jQuery, Bootstrap, logic using conditional
statements, moment.js for getting the current time, and setting values 
in local storage.
